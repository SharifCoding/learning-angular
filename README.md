Angular is a JavaScript framework, maintained by Google, itâ€™s a MVC (Module view controller).

Right now, the latest version of Angular is 6.x There is first generation 1.x and second generation 2.x, and the two generations are totally diferent in their structures and methods.

Angular uses TypeScript for implementing the logic, in which files end with `.ts` extension. TypeScript is a language built on top of JavaScript but which is type safe, and TypeScript in turn compiles to JavaScript.
